Critics Document: GoMUD Project Design Review (Self-Analysis)


  This document provides a critical analysis of the GoMUD project design documents. While the overall architecture is sound, several areas require further clarification and detail
  to be considered implementation-ready.


  General Architectural Concerns (High-Impact)


   1. Missing Database Schema: This is the most significant omission. The entire architecture is described as "Database-Centric," yet there is no SCHEMA.md or appendix detailing the
      tables, columns, data types, and relationships (e.g., foreign keys, one-to-many, many-to-many). Without this, the Data Access Layer (DAL) cannot be properly designed, and the
      Go structs are just conceptual.
       * Recommendation: Create a SCHEMA.md document in the design directory that explicitly defines the database schema.


   2. Vague Web Editor Architecture: The design states the web editor interacts "directly with the DAL." This is ambiguous. Does the main GoMUD server binary also act as the web
      server? If so, this tightly couples the game server with the admin tool. If not, how does a separate web server process access the Go DAL of the main application?
       * Recommendation: Clarify the deployment architecture. State explicitly that the main Go application will also run a lightweight web server on a separate port for the admin
         interface, and this web server will call the DAL functions internally.


   3. Undefined Quest System: Phase 6 mentions creating a "simple, guided questline," but no part of the design defines a quest system. How are quests defined? How is player progress
      tracked (e.g., kill ten rats, talk to NPC Bob)? How are rewards given? This is a major gameplay system that is completely missing from the data model and engine design.
       * Recommendation: Add a Quest struct to the data model and a QuestManager to the Core Game Engine. Define quest objectives, progress tracking, and reward mechanics.


  Phase-Specific Criticisms

  Phase 1: Foundation & Content Tools


   * Incompleteness: The Player struct is defined, but the persistence of a player's dynamic state (current health, inventory, location) is not explicitly addressed. The design must
     state that player state is loaded on login and saved periodically or on logout via the DAL.
   * Ambiguity: The "Test Data Requirements" are excellent examples, but they don't specify where this data lives. It should be explicitly stated that this data will be stored in a
     seed file (e.g., seed.sql or seed.json) that the application can use to populate a fresh database for testing.


  Phase 2: Lore & Data Logic


   * Incompleteness: The DAL's in-memory caching is mentioned, but the caching strategy is not defined. What is the eviction policy (e.g., LRU, LFU)? What is the cache's scope
     (e.g., global, per-player)?
       * Recommendation: Specify a simple, global, in-memory cache for static data like lore and tool definitions. State that the cache is populated at startup and invalidated by
         DAL update/delete operations.

  Phase 3: LLM Integration & Memory


   * Ambiguity: The design states the LLM will return XML (<response>...). Why XML and not a unified JSON response? This choice is not justified and adds a second parsing dependency
     (XML and JSON) to the system.
       * Recommendation: Simplify the design by having the LLM return a single JSON object, e.g., {"narrative": "...", "tools": [...]}. This removes the need for an XML parser.


  Phase 4: Sentient Entities & Action Significance


   * Incompleteness: The "Action Significance Monitor" is a good concept, but its implementation details are vague. Where does the "action buffer" live? How is it garbage-collected
     for logged-out players?
       * Recommendation: Specify that the action buffer is an in-memory map attached to the active player's session object. When a player logs out, their session and the associated
         action buffer are destroyed.
   * Ambiguity: The trigger mechanism is unclear. What happens if a single action has a score higher than the threshold? Does it trigger immediately? What if multiple actions push
     the score over the threshold at once?
       * Recommendation: Define the rule explicitly: "An LLM prompt is triggered the moment an entity's cumulative score for a player meets or exceeds its threshold. After
         triggering, the score for that entity is reset to zero."

  Phase 5: Advanced Mechanics & Skills


   * Weak Design: The Skills data model is the weakest part of the design. The Effects field is a generic map, which offloads all complexity to the engine. This is not a scalable or
     maintainable design.
       * Recommendation: Redesign the skill system. Define a more structured Effect model, e.g., Effect{ Type: "HEAL", Value: 20, Target: "SELF" } or Effect{ Type:
         "MODIFY_ATTRIBUTE", Attribute: "stealth", Value: 5, Target: "SELF" }. The Core Game Engine would then have a clear, data-driven way to apply these effects.
   * Incompleteness: The design doesn't state how players acquire or level up skills. This is a fundamental part of the game loop.
       * Recommendation: Add a PlayerSkills table to the schema and a mechanism for learning/improving skills (e.g., trainers, level-up points).

  Phase 6: Concurrency & Final Polish


   * Vague Implementation: "Conditional AI Delivery" is described as a "queueing system," but the implementation is not detailed.
       * Recommendation: Propose a concrete implementation. For example: "When an LLM response is generated, it is not sent directly. Instead, an AIResponseEvent is created with the
         response data and a set of delivery conditions (e.g., player_must_be_in_room: 'room_id'). A central EventQueue processes these events on each game tick, and only dispatches
         the response if its conditions are met."
