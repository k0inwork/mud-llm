# Phase 2 Results: Lore & Data Logic

This document summarizes the completed work for Phase 2, focusing on Data Access Layer (DAL) enhancements and in-memory caching.

## 1. Objectives Achieved

All objectives for Phase 2 have been successfully met:

*   **Enhanced Data Access Layer (DAL):**
    *   Implemented `GetAll` methods for all core entities: `Room`, `Item`, `NPC`, `Owner`, `Lore`, `Player`, `PlayerQuestState`, `Quest`, `Questmaker`, `Race`, `Profession`, `Skill`, `Class`, `PlayerClass`.
    *   Implemented `GetNPCsByRoom`, `GetNPCsByOwner`, `GetOwnersByMonitoredAspect`, `GetItemsInRoom`, `GetPlayerInventory` for advanced querying.

*   **In-Memory Caching within DAL:**
    *   Implemented a generic `Cache` struct with `Set`, `SetMany`, `Get`, `Delete`, and `Clear` methods.
    *   Integrated cache pre-warming for all relevant DAL entities (`Room`, `Item`, `NPC`, `Owner`, `Lore`, `Player`, `PlayerQuestState`, `Quest`, `Questmaker`, `Race`, `Profession`, `Skill`, `Class`, `PlayerClass`, `QuestOwner`) on server startup in `main.go`.
    *   Implemented cache invalidation on `Update` and `Delete` operations within the DALs.

*   **Data Loading and Initialization:**
    *   The server startup sequence (`main.go`) now correctly initializes the database and pre-warms the caches by loading data via the DALs.

## 2. Documents Added/Modified

*   **`design/phase-2-lore-and-data-logic/README.md`**: Updated to reflect the completed objectives and test data requirements.
*   **`internal/dal/cache.go`**: Implemented the generic caching mechanism.
*   **`internal/dal/room_dal.go`**: Added `GetAllRooms`.
*   **`internal/dal/item_dal.go`**: Added `GetAllItems`.
*   **`internal/dal/npc_dal.go`**: Added `GetAllNPCs`.
*   **`internal/dal/owner_dal.go`**: Added `GetAllOwners`.
*   **`internal/dal/lore_dal.go`**: Added `GetAllLore`.
*   **`internal/dal/player_dal.go`**: Added `GetAllPlayers`.
*   **`internal/dal/player_quest_state_dal.go`**: Added `GetAllPlayerQuestStates`.
*   **`internal/dal/quest_dal.go`**: Added `GetAllQuests`.
*   **`internal/dal/questmaker_dal.go`**: Added `GetAllQuestmakers`.
*   **`internal/dal/race_dal.go`**: Added `GetAllRaces`.
*   **`internal/dal/profession_dal.go`**: Added `GetAllProfessions`.
*   **`internal/dal/skill_dal.go`**: Added `GetAllSkills`.
*   **`internal/dal/class_dal.go`**: Added `GetAllClasses`.
*   **`internal/dal/player_class_dal.go`**: Added `GetAllPlayerClasses`.
*   **`internal/dal/dal.go`**: Updated `DAL` struct and `NewDAL` to include all new DALs.
*   **`internal/dal/seed.go`**: Expanded seed data to include all lore examples from `design/phase-2-lore-and-data-logic/README.md`.
*   **`main.go`**: Updated to include cache pre-warming for all relevant DALs.

## 3. Test Data Expansion

*   The `internal/dal/seed.go` file was expanded to include all additional lore entries specified in `design/phase-2-lore-and-data-logic/README.md`.

## 4. Verification

*   All unit and integration tests within the `internal/` directory are passing, confirming the correct implementation and functionality of the DAL enhancements and caching mechanisms.

## 5. Refinements during Phase 2

During the course of Phase 2, the following refinements were made to the overall design, which will be fully realized in Phase 3:

*   **Clarified Quest Roles:** A clear distinction was established between:
    *   **Owners:** Initiate quests (offer them to players).
    *   **Quest Owners (NEW Entity):** Thematic, high-level supervisors of quest lines, responsible for global world changes and with a time-based influence budget.
    *   **Questmakers (Refined Role):** Controllers of individual quest execution, responsible for local quest progression and with a player-action-based influence budget.
*   **New Data Model:** Introduced `QuestOwner` struct in `internal/models/quest_owner.go`.
*   **New DAL:** Implemented `QuestOwnerDAL` in `internal/dal/quest_owner_dal.go`.
*   **Updated Relationships:** Modified `Owner` to include `InitiatedQuests`, and `Quest` to include `QuestOwnerID`.
*   **Budget Allocation:** Re-assigned budget types (time-based vs. player-action-based) and tool exclusivity to align with the new roles.

These refinements ensure a more robust and scalable quest system for future phases.
