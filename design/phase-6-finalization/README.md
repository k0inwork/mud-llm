# Phase 6 Design: Concurrency & Final Polish

## 1. Objectives

This final phase focuses on stability, performance, and the overall user experience. The goal is to transform the functional prototype into a robust, polished MUD that can handle multiple players smoothly and provides a high-quality, immersive experience.

## 2. Key Components to be Implemented

### 2.1. Concurrency and Performance

*   **Concurrent LLM Calls:**
    *   All calls to the LLM API will be refactored to run in their own Go routines.
    *   This is critical for actions that can trigger multiple AI responses, such as a `pray` command (prompting multiple Owners) or a `say` command (prompting multiple NPCs in a room).
    *   `sync.WaitGroup` or channels will be used to manage these concurrent calls and ensure the system doesn't block while waiting for responses.
*   **State Management Review:**
    *   A thorough review of the entire codebase will be conducted to identify any shared data that could be subject to race conditions.
    *   `sync.Mutex` or `sync.RWMutex` will be added to protect all shared game state (e.g., `Room` inventories, `Player` stats) from concurrent access by multiple player commands or AI tool calls.

### 2.2. Conditional AI Delivery

*   A queueing system for AI responses will be implemented.
*   When an LLM response is generated for a player, instead of being sent immediately, it will be placed in a queue for that player.
*   The system will check for conditions before delivering the message. For example, an NPC's reaction to a player entering a room should only be delivered if the player is still in that room. This prevents messages from "following" players who have already moved on.

### 2.3. Final Polish and Content Expansion

*   **Telnet Client Enhancements:** The `TelnetRenderer` will be refined. A full set of `semantic_type`s will be defined, and the ANSI color/style map will be completed to ensure the text presentation is clear and aesthetically pleasing.
*   **Web Editor Finalization:** The web editor's UI/UX will be polished to make it as intuitive and easy to use as possible for game administrators.
*   **Initial World Content:** A small, self-contained starting area will be built out using the web editor. This will include:
    *   A few interconnected rooms.
    *   Several NPCs with distinct personalities and lore.
    *   At least one Owner.
    *   A simple quest involving item interaction and talking to NPCs.
    *   The necessary lore entries to make the world feel cohesive.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

1.  The server can handle multiple simultaneous LLM API calls without blocking or crashing.
2.  All shared game state is demonstrably protected by mutexes, and no race conditions can be found during stress testing.
3.  The conditional AI delivery system works correctly (e.g., delayed messages are not delivered if the player has moved to a new room).
4.  The Telnet client's output is well-formatted, colorful, and easy to read.
5.  The web editor is fully functional and user-friendly.
6.  A new player can log in, complete the simple starting quest, and have a satisfying and immersive experience.
